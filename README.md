# hermes

In order to build and run the application yourself, you will need "src", which contains all the application source code, as well as "resources", which contains application resources. Data contains the sample data which was used in developing Hermes. Hermes is compiled for Java 9, and is developed with OpenJDK 15.0.1.

If you would simply like to run the application, you have the following options:
1. Hermes.jar - a standalone java executable. This will run on Windows and MacOS (it will run on some Linux distributions but has not been tested). This requires Java to be installed. It may need to be run from the command line with "java -jar Hermes.jar", and will require Java 9 or higher.
2. Hermes.exe - an executable version of Hermes with openjdk15 bundled. This should run on Windows even without any version of java installed. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/xasheffield/hermes/releases.
