# hermes

In order to build and run the application yourself, you will need "src", which contains all the application source code, as well as "resources", which contains resources. Data contains the sample data which was used in developing Hermes.

If you would simply like to run the application, you have the following options provided in the "artifacts" directory:
1. Hermes.jar - a standalone executable jar file. This will run on Windows and MacOS (it will run on some Linux distributions but has not been tested). This requires Java to be installed.
2. Hermes.exe - an executable version of Hermes with openjdk15 bundled. This should run on Windows even without any version of java installed.
